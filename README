About:

    The Sandbox is a collection of tests for 3rd party components used by XLang.
    Currently, it includes the following:

        test_coroutine
        test_functor
        test_ticpp
        test_tinyxml
        test_visitor

Requirements:

    Unix tools (must be accessible from $PATH):

        gcc (with -std=c++0x support), ticpp (static library and headers)

    Environment variables:

        $EXTERN_INCLUDE_PATH -- where "ticpp/ticpp.h" resides
        $EXTERN_LIB_PATH -- where "libticppd.a" resides

Make targets:

    all, test, clean.

    all:    make binaries
    test:   all + run tests
    clean:  remove all intermediate files
